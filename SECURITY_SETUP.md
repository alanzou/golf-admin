# Security Setup Guide

This guide covers the critical security improvements that have been implemented in the golf-admin application.

## üö® Critical Security Configuration

### 1. JWT Secret Configuration

**Before deploying to production**, you MUST set a secure JWT secret:

```bash
# Generate a secure JWT secret
openssl rand -base64 32

# Add to your .env.local file
JWT_SECRET="your-generated-secret-here"
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: The application will now throw an error if JWT_SECRET is not provided, preventing insecure deployments.

### 2. Environment Variables

Copy `env.example` to `.env.local` and configure all required variables:

```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

Required variables:
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `KV_REST_API_URL`: Redis URL for caching and rate limiting
- `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`: Redis authentication token
- `JWT_SECRET`: Strong secret key for JWT tokens

### 3. Database Security

New indexes have been added for performance and security:

```bash
# Run migration to add indexes
npx prisma db push
```

### 4. Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is now active on:
- Login endpoints: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- General API: 100 requests per minute
- Sensitive operations: 10 requests per minute

### 5. Input Validation

All API endpoints now use Zod schemas for validation:
- Prevents SQL injection
- Validates data types and formats
- Sanitizes user input

## üìã Security Checklist

Before going to production:

- [ ] Set strong JWT_SECRET
- [ ] Configure Redis for rate limiting
- [ ] Run database migrations for indexes
- [ ] Test rate limiting functionality
- [ ] Verify input validation on all forms
- [ ] Set up HTTPS in production
- [ ] Configure CORS properly
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting

## üîç Monitoring

The new logging system provides:
- Structured logging for production
- Security event tracking
- Audit trails for sensitive operations
- Request ID tracking

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Implement the remaining phases:
   - Phase 2: Code Quality (Testing, Linting)
   - Phase 3: Performance (Caching, Optimization)
   - Phase 4: DevOps (CI/CD, Monitoring)

2. Consider additional security measures:
   - CORS configuration
   - CSP headers
   - Session management
   - API versioning
   - External security audits
